# NetNewsWire: Our App Philosophy

We believe that apps should never crash. They should be free of bugs. They should be fast -- they should feel lighter-than-air.

We believe that quality is more important than just piling on features; we believe that quality is the most important feature. And we believe that high quality is transformative -- it makes for an app you never hesitate to reach for. You can rely on it, and you do, again and again.

This makes us slow to add features. We are adding features -- but never at the expense of how it feels. Never at the expense of reliability and speed.
