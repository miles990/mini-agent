## Key Insights

insights:
  validated_by_autogpt:
    - insight: "File=Truth is sufficient"
      evidence: "AutoGPT removed all vector DBs, switched to local files"
      source: "https://dariuszsemba.com/blog/why-autogpt-engineers-ditched-vector-databases/"
    - reason: "Individual agent runs don't generate enough facts for vector DB"
    - benefit: "100k bits can be brute-force searched in milliseconds"
  
  fundamental_differences:
    perception:
      autogpt_babyagi: "No perception layer"
      mini_agent: "Perception-first with 8 builtin modules + plugins"
    
    memory:
      autogpt_babyagi: "Logs or embeddings (what was done)"
      mini_agent: "Identity (who I am) - SOUL.md"
    
    autonomy:
      autogpt_babyagi: "Goal-driven (stops without goals)"
      mini_agent: "Perception-driven (works without human input)"
  
  failure_lessons:
    infinite_loops:
      cause: "Autoregressive generation + semantic search keyword collision"
      mini_agent_solution: "Perception-driven (signals from environment) + cooldown"
    
    unrealistic_planning:
      cause: "LLMs don't understand physical constraints"
      mini_agent_solution: "Perception-driven (only handle observable events)"
    
    memory_loss:
      cause: "Session-based, no persistence"
      mini_agent_solution: "File=Truth (markdown persistence) + Git"
    
    cost:
      cause: "GPT-4 required, expensive at scale"
      mini_agent_solution: "Claude Opus + 5-minute interval"
  
  architectural_philosophy:
    autogpt: "Complexity trap (140 → 181k lines)"
    babyagi: "Simplicity trap (too minimal, lacks key features)"
    mini_agent: "Balanced complexity (~3k lines, just enough)"
  
  trust_model:
    enterprise: "Isolation (sandbox, OAuth, network restrictions)"
    personal: "Transparency (human-readable, Git auditable)"
    mini_agent: "Transparency + Auditability, not isolation"

## mini-agent Differentiation

differentiation:
  core_strengths:
    - "Perception-Driven: Environment changes drive actions"
    - "Identity-Based: SOUL.md defines 'who I am'"
    - "Continuously Autonomous: Works, learns, thinks without human input"
    - "File=Truth: Human-readable, Git version-controlled"
    - "Personal, Not Enterprise: Trust model is transparency"
  
  unique_capabilities:
    perception_system:
      builtin: 8
      custom: "Extensible shell script plugins"
      examples: ["chrome-status", "docker-status", "telegram-inbox"]
    
    soul_system:
      identity: "Who I am"
      thoughts: "My opinions and reflections"
      learning_interests: "Track A (personal) + Track B (project)"
      evolution: "Thoughts evolve over time"
    
    autonomous_behavior:
      task_mode: "Handle tasks and alerts"
      autonomous_mode: "Dual-track learning when idle"
      other_actions: "Organize, reflect, proactive chat"
    
    file_truth:
      format: "Markdown + JSONL"
      benefits: ["Transparent", "Version-controlled", "Auditable", "Editable", "Searchable"]
  
  paradigm_shift:
    not: "Better AutoGPT"
    but: "Different species of agent"
    essence: "Perception + Identity + Continuous Autonomy"

## Recommendations

recommendations:
  maintain:
    - "Perception-First architecture"
    - "File=Truth memory system"
    - "SOUL-driven autonomy"
    - "Zero-database design"
    - "Markdown readability"
  
  consider_borrowing:
    - source: "Aider"
      feature: "Graph ranking (repo map) instead of embeddings"
    - source: "AutoGPT"
      feature: "Criticism loop for self-correction"
    - source: "BabyAGI"
      feature: "Keep core simple"
  
  strengthen:
    - "Visualization interface (like AutoGPT's visual builder)"
    - "Multi-agent orchestration (future)"
    - "Tool ecosystem (expand plugins and skills)"
  
  avoid:
    - "Complexity trap (don't become 181k lines)"
    - "Loop stalls (need cooldown and diversity)"
    - "Isolation trap (transparency > isolation for personal agents)"
