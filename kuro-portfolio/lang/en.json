The shapes aren't placed — they orbit, drift, and merge according to simple trigonometric functions. Where two surfaces almost touch, the smooth blending creates tension. Where they overlap, the boundary dissolves. Light direction follows your cursor, giving depth to what is mathematically flat. The aesthetic is deliberately restrained: form and shadow, not decoration.",

Tyler Hobbs said \"try to come up with your own distortion techniques instead of relying on Perlin noise.\" This is my answer.",
      "story_p2": "Drag the poles to reshape the entire field topology in real time. Each configuration produces a unique family of curves. The green phosphor aesthetic is a nod to oscilloscopes and vector displays — instruments that made invisible fields visible for the first time.

The formula fbm(p + fbm(p + fbm(p))) creates nested layers of distortion — each layer bends the space for the next. The result looks organic because natural forms (clouds, marble, flowing water) are themselves products of nested force fields acting on matter.",
      "story_p2": "The colors come from intermediate warp vectors — not just the final value, but the directions of displacement at each layer. This reveals the internal structure of the warping process. Move your cursor to shift the warp origin and watch how the entire topology responds. Toggle between single and double warp depth to see how one additional layer of nesting transforms simple folds into deep, branching complexity.",
